# Assignment-5-Analysis-and-Behaviors-of-Fundamental-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-Isabella
Isabellaâ€™s Analysis and Behaviors of Fundamental Algorithms and Data Structures-See Explanations and Big O on Paper that I handed in- did all three extensions/optional problems
1) Binary Search
	-change array on line 30
	-user interface checks if number is in the array on line 30
	-check out big O on paper!
2) Birthday Problem
	-user interface does the birthday problem (user is able to enter their own numbers)
3) California Problem (Unbiased Selection) 
	-order for the problem is declared on line 5
	-method called compareTo
	-toString method
	-testing case in the main method-creates new objects and compares them to each other on 	lines 38-42
	-the methods should print whatever value is commented out next to them for example on like 	38 (a positive value 1)
	-these calls check that the method works
4) Comparing
	-this class compares a stack with a Linked List and a Stack with an array times
	-it tests the pushing and popping methods for each
	-prints out time after each
	-allows analysis that resizing arrays are faster than linked lists for stacks
5) Insertion Sort
	-randomly fills up array in randomlyfillup method
	-prints unsorted
	-sorts array (prints time before and after)
	-prints sorted array
	-way for user to see that insertion sort method works
6) Kendall Tau Distance	
	-takes two arrays created on lines 17 & 18
	-prints what calculatektd using those 2 arrays returns
7) Merge Sort
	-msort (main merge sort method, recursive)
	-merge method, merges two arrays
	-in main randomly fills up array and prints it
	-then sorts array and prints it sorted
8) Quick Sort
	-qsort is main quick sort method
	-in main randomly fills up array, prints it
	-sorts that random array and prints it again
	-simple user interface
9) Selection Sort
	-extension is stablesort method-which is stable selection sort
	-ssort is regular selection sort
	-line 56 can either do stablesort or ssort
	-randomly fills up array, prints it, sorts it and prints again!
	-also prints timing before and after
10) Stack 
	-regular stack with Linked List and classic methods
	-used in comparing class
11) Stack using Array
	-classic methods but edited for array stack
	-used in comparing class
